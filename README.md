# fpv-dvca
An unofficial companion app for DJI's Digital FPV System for Android devices.
Plug your Android device into your Googles and watch a live feed on your phone.

If this app doesn't tickle your fancy, maybe [this one](https://github.com/fpvout/DigiView-Android) from @jlucidar floats your boat.
