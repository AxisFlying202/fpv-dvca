# fpv-dvca
An unofficial companion app for DJI's Digital FPV System for Android devices.
Plug your Android device into your Googles and watch a live feed on your phone.

If this app doesn't tickle your fancy, maybe [this one](https://github.com/fpvout/DigiView-Android) from [@jlucidar](https://github.com/jlucidar) does.

Want to chat? There is a [discord server here](https://discord.gg/q5gHFXAs9e).
Be nice. No is getting paid to do any of this, we all just like FPV.

Thank you:
* [@fpv-wtf](https://github.com/fpv-wtf) for jump starting everything by finding the magic USB sauce
* [@jlucidar](https://github.com/jlucidar) for laying the groundwork with his app
* D3VL nourishing a nice community
